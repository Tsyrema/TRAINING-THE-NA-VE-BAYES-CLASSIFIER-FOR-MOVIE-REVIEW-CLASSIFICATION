# TRAINING-THE-NAIVE-BAYES-CLASSIFIER-FOR-MOVIE-REVIEW-CLASSIFICATION

Implement in Python a Na√Øve Bayes classifier with bag-of-word features and add-1 smoothing. 
Note: Smoothing should be used for the context features (bag-of-word features) only. Do not use smoothing for the prior parameters.

Use the following small corpus of movie reviews to train your classifier. Save the parameters of your model in a file called movie-review.NB
a) fun, couple, love, love comedy
b) fast, furious, shoot action
c) couple, fly, fast, fun, fun comedy
d) furious, shoot, shoot, fun action
e) fly, fast, shoot, love action

Test you classifier on the new document below: {fast, couple, shoot, fly}. Compute the most likely class. Report the probabilities for each class.
